As of early 2016 it is reported by sources to be $6 million, gained mostly from his career in music, his own band and through collaborations with other artists.</p><h3>Tyler Joseph Net Worth $6 Million</h3><p>Born in Columbus, Ohio, Joseph grew up with two brothers and a sister to parents Kelly and Chris who are both educators in different schools. Growing up in a Christian family, Joseph was home-schooled during the early years of his education, and later enrolled at Worthington Christian High School where his father served as a coach and principal. During his stay in Worthington, Joseph played for the basketball team as the point guard, and his performance was noticed by Otterbein University which offered him a scholarship to play for their school, but Joseph refused because of his passion for music. After a night in a High Street club, he fell in love with music and immediately started writing music and even practised his vocals.</p><p>In 2009, the band “Twenty One Pilots” was born. Joseph conceptualized the idea and asked his high school friends Nick Thomas and Chris Salih to accompany him, and the trio released their first album in December. The group started to gain attention and even toured Ohio, which helped in their popularity and net worth.</p><p>Due to conflicting schedules in 2011, Thomas and Salih left the group and were replaced by Joseph Dun. In July of the same year, the band released their second album “Regional at Best”. Back then the two played in small venues, but their second independent album led them to be approached by several recording labels, eventually signing with the recording label “Fueled by Ramen”, a subsidiary label of Atlantic Records, in 2012. The following year, the group released their first album with their new recording label entitled “Vessel”.</p><p>“Vessel” became a nationwide hit and entered several music charts. The success of the album led the duo to be the opening act for the band “Fall Out Boy” on their “Save Rock and Roll” Tour. The achievement of the album cemented the name of the band in the music industry and increased their net worth.</p><p>Aside from “Twenty One Pilots”, Joseph has also worked with several other artists, and before the success of his duo band, Joseph produced his solo album “No Phun Intended” back in 2007. In 2010, he collaborated with Christian rapper Jocef in the song entitled “Live”. He also worked with Five14 Church, which he helped with some of the tracks in their worship albums, and also collaborated with <a href=#>Dallon Weekes</a> of “Panic at the Disco”. These different collaborations showed Joseph’s range as an artist and also helped in his net worth.</p><p>Recently Joseph’s band released its latest album entitled “Blurryface” last March of 2015 and it was instant hit among fans.</p><p>In terms of his personal life, Joseph has been married to Jenna Black since March of 2015.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=17.170303030303><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Tyler Joseph</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$6 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>1st of December, 1988</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Columbus, Ohio</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>American musician, singer, rapper</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>Worthington Christian High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Jenna Black (2015)</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Kelly, Chris Joseph</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Siblings</td><td>Zack Joseph, Madison Joseph, Jay Joseph, Heathens, Ride, Stressed Out</td></tr><tr readability=0.35555555555556><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/tylerrjoseph</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.35897435897436><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/tylerrjoseph</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.38297872340426><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/tylerrjoseph</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm5888677</a></td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Record Labels</td><td>Fueled by Ramen, Atlantic Records (2012), Vessel</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Albums</td><td>Regional at Best (2011), No Phun Intended (2007), Blurryface (2015)</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Music Groups</td><td>Twenty One Pilots (2009), Fall Out Boy, Panic at the Disco,</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Nominations</td><td>Grammy Award for Best Rock Song, Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media, Heathens, Ride, Stressed Out</td></tr></table><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/networthpost.org/wp-content/themes/net-worth/images/celebrity_net_worth.png><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritypictures.org/thumbs/5888677/5888677_1.jpeg><h3 class=toggle-head>Soundtrack <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=soundtrack readability=2><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>Late Night with Seth Meyers</td><td>2014-2015</td><td>TV Series writer -
