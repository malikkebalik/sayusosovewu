Fryer was conscripted before Clapton was born and returned to Canada. Clapton grew up believing that his grandmother, Rose, and her second husband, Patricia's stepfather, Jack Clapp, were his parents, and that his mother was his elder sister. The closeness in surnames led to the mistaken idea that Clapton's true surname is Clapp (Reginald Cecil Clapton was Rose's first husband, Eric Clapton's maternal grandpa). Years later, Eric's mother married another Canadian soldier who relocated to Germany, leaving Eric in the care of his grandparents in Surrey.</p><p><strong>Professional Career: -&nbsp;</strong>Clapton joined the Yardbirds, a blues-influenced rock and roll band, in October 1963 and lasted with them until March 1965. Clapton established a distinct sound by combining elements from Chicago blues and renowned blues guitarists such as Buddy Guy, Freddie King, and B.B. King, and quickly became one of the most started talking guitarists in the British music industry. The band first performed Chess/Checker/Vee-Jay blues pieces and gained considerable cult status when they took over Rolling Stones' residency at Richmond's Crawdaddy Club. They toured England with American bluesman Sonny Boy Williamson II, and a combined LP recording was released in 1965.</p><h2><strong><strong>Net Worth of&nbsp;Eric Clapton</strong></strong></h2><p>His Net Worth is $1-$5 Million.</p><h2><strong><strong>Social Account of Eric Clapton</strong></strong></h2><p>Instagram:&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Click here</strong></a></p><p>Facebook:&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Click here</strong></a></p><p>Twitter:&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Click here</strong></a></p><p>Wikipedia:&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Click here</strong></a></p><h2><strong><strong>FAQ About Eric Clapton</strong></strong></h2><p><strong>Q.1 Who is Eric Clapton?</strong></p><p>Ans.
