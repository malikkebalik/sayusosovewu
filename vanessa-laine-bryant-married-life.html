<time>10 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><a href=#><strong>Vanessa Laine Bryant</strong></a> is famous for being the widow of American professional basketball player, <strong>Kobe Bryant</strong>. Kobe, a shooting guard, is regarded for being the best player of all time. He spent his entire career in the National Basketball Association with the Los Angeles Lakers.</p><p>So, what is happening in the life of Vanessa currently? Let's take a glance at the couple's unfortunate marital relationship and their kids in the following section.</p><h2>How Vanessa First Met Her Better Half Kobe?</h2><p>Laine, a native of California, met the love of her life Bryant for the first time in November 1999. At the time, she was working as a background dancer in the music video 'G'd Up' by rappers Snoop Dogg and Tha Eastsidaz. He was working on an album in the same building that was never released.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/9/29/200823-vanessa-kobe-bryant-jm-1248_4aafde9122896387f8f28015321eae08.nbcnews-fp-1200-630-1601391955638.jpg><p>Shortly after the shoot, the NBA star asked her for her number on November 28, 1999, and then they began communicating. After finding some links with each other, they went to Disneyland on their first date. Their relationship soon gained media attention when they attended Marina High School in Huntington Beach, California.</p><p>Suddenly, now 38, Vanessa became Kobe's faithful partner and began making appearances with him at games and on red carpets. Finally six months later after they first met, the 1.98&nbsp;m tall Bryant popped the question at her 18th birthday party on May 5.</p><h2>Got Married At Young Age. Know the Wedding Details!</h2><p>After less than two years of their first meeting, the lovebirds became a husband and husband on April 18, 2001. Their wedding function was held at St. Edward the Confessor Catholic Church in Dana Point in Southern California.</p><p>The ceremony was intimate and only had about twelve guests. But Kobe's parents, <a href=#>Pam</a>, and <strong>Joe</strong>, and even his two sisters <strong>Sharia</strong>, <strong>Saya</strong>&nbsp;didn't attend their big day. His parents had problems with him getting married so young, and particularly to a woman who was not African-American.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/9/29/d54f6a7df14398a39743df30405c8c49-1601392626352.jpg><p>Thus, this dispute resulted in a disconnection period of over two years. But Bryant finally reconciled with his parents after his firstborn daughter's birth.&nbsp;</p><h2>Vanessa Filed For A Divorce From Kobe in 2011</h2><p>Yes, Laine Bryant once filed a divorce petition from 10 years of husband Kobe on &nbsp;December 16, 2011, after a decade of marital life. In Orange County Superior Court, she cited irreconcilable differences was the main reason behind their separation.</p><p>But on January 11, 2013, Vanessa and her spouse, Bryant took social media to announce that they had called off their divorce. She wrote on her IG wall: " We are looking forward to our future together".&nbsp;</p><p>"When the show ends and the music stops, the journey is made beautiful by having that someone to share it with", Kobe wrote on his Facebook page.</p><h2>Vanessa and Kobe's Four Children</h2><p>Fewer than one year after they got married, the duo thrilled fans when they started in September 2002 that they were expecting a first child together. Officially, they became parents when their oldest daughter <a href=#><strong>Natalia Diamante Bryant</strong></a>, was born on January 19, 2003.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/9/29/1043-1601392016572.jpg><p>Three years later, the duo's second-born daughter <a href=#><strong>Gianna Bryant</strong></a> was born on May 1, 2006. After a decade after the birth of their second child, they gave birth to their third daughter, <strong>Bianka Bryant</strong>, in 2016.&nbsp;</p><p>In January 2019, they announced they were welcoming their fourth baby girl. Their youngest daughter <strong>Capri Kobe Bryant</strong> was welcomed in June 2019.</p><h2>The Tragical Death of Kobe and 13-year-old Daughter Gianna</h2><p>The NBA star, Kobe, and his daughter Gianna were among the nine victims who were <a href=#><strong>killed in the crash</strong></a><strong> </strong>when traveling to the Thousand Oaks, California, Mamba on January 26, 2020. According to data from Flightradar24, the helicopter was flying at about 184 mph and was descending at more than 4,000 feet per minute when it finally crashed.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/9/29/5e4374383b62b764eb426993-1601389172259.jpg><p>A few hours later, Vanessa shared a heartbreak tribute to her late husband and daughter on her Instagram account saying that she and her family "devastated" by the sudden loss of them. She also revealed a fund to help the families of the other seven individuals killed in the helicopter crash.&nbsp;</p><p>Two weeks later, her husband Kobe and daughter Gianna <a href=# rel=nofollow>were buried </a>in an Orange County private funeral service. The funeral was held in Corona del Mar at Pacific View Memorial Park on February 7, Friday. But the public was given a chance to honor them at a memorial service.</p><p><i><strong>If You Are Looking For More Interesting Articles Of Your Favourite Celebrities, Then Visit&nbsp;</strong></i><a href=#><i><strong>Married Celeb</strong></i></a><i><strong>!!!</strong></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jq%2BYp52jqK5uuMCipZ5lkqfGorrTZqSaqqKesqV5y6Kdng%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fvanessa-laine-bryant-married-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fvanessa-laine-bryant-married-life.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fvanessa-laine-bryant-married-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fvanessa-laine-bryant-married-life.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fvanessa-laine-bryant-married-life.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fvanessa-laine-bryant-married-life.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bryce-young-s-smile-and-quiet-confidence-are-making-his-teammates-believers.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bryce-young-s-smile-and-quiet-confidence-are-making-his-teammates-believers.html>Bryce Youngs smile and quiet confidence are making his teammates believers</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-the-christmas-guest-by-reba-mcentire.html>The Meaning Behind The Song: The Christmas Guest by Reba McEntire</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-the-christmas-guest-by-reba-mcentire.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
