I’m not sure that that’s entirely true,” del Carmen told the outlet.</p><p>He questioned why the deputy used his Taser when Cure had his back turned to him and raised his hand.</p><p>“From what you can see on the video, it doesn’t seem to me that this will be the type of call or the nature of the event that would require for an officer to tase the suspect,” del Carmen said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">&nbsp;Leonard in an undated family photo. <span class=credit>Facebook/Innocence Project of Florida</span></figure><p>&nbsp;“If the officer has in fact, a history, that he has been using force in the past, and he’s been disciplined in the past, to the extent of being fired, then the police department has a very serious problem in their hands right now,” he added.</p><p>Cure, who was serving a life sentence after he was convicted in 2003 of an armed robbery of a Walgreens in Broward County, Fla., was exonerated and released in 2020 through the work of the Innocence Project of Florida.</p><p>A Broward State Attorney’s Office Conviction Review Unit found that Cure had a solid alibi — in the form of a time-stamped ATM receipt miles away — at the time of the robbery.</p><p>Cure had recently purchased a house in Palmetto, Ga., with some of the $817,000 he received from the state of Florida this summer for his wrongful conviction and incarceration.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGlma2hfmLyxedahpmaekamurbjYZqqhp6Risrm7zZ6pmqyVmXqurc1mrpqrXZu2s7HDZqCnZWJlfnh5xaipZq2jnruoecSxmp6ro57DpnnFqKmcnV2ZwrO1zaBkraqRm7Oqr4ysq6ioXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcop-who-fatally-shot-exonerated-man-was-fired-in-2017-for-using-excessive-force-during-traffic-stop.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcop-who-fatally-shot-exonerated-man-was-fired-in-2017-for-using-excessive-force-during-traffic-stop.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcop-who-fatally-shot-exonerated-man-was-fired-in-2017-for-using-excessive-force-during-traffic-stop.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcop-who-fatally-shot-exonerated-man-was-fired-in-2017-for-using-excessive-force-during-traffic-stop.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcop-who-fatally-shot-exonerated-man-was-fired-in-2017-for-using-excessive-force-during-traffic-stop.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcop-who-fatally-shot-exonerated-man-was-fired-in-2017-for-using-excessive-force-during-traffic-stop.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./olivia-wilde-and-jason-sudeikis-relationship-timeline-from-a-seven-year-engagement-to-harry-style.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./olivia-wilde-and-jason-sudeikis-relationship-timeline-from-a-seven-year-engagement-to-harry-style.html>Olivia Wilde and Jason Sudeikis relationship timeline from a seven year engagement to Harry Style</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./boywithuke-face-reveal-sparks-massive-reaction-who-is-he-the-talks-today.html>BoyWithUke Face Reveal Sparks Massive Reaction; Who Is He?
