She was a child of his marriage to Deborah “Tatiana” Mays, his ex-wife. Joe might have had a happy existence on the football field, but his private life wasn’t exactly moon and beaches.</h3><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>It might be said that his personal life had its fair share of ups and downs, from having trouble adjusting to his adolescent kids to divorcing his wife of sixteen years. However, we are focusing on his youngest daughter, Olivia, who has experienced her own share of difficulties.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Her Hungarian-Catholic, steelworker paternal grandparents were Rose (née Juhász) and János “John” Andrew Namath. András “Andrew” Németh, also known as “A.J.” to Olivia’s family, was born in Hungary and immigrated to Ellis Island on the vessel Pannonia in 1911. He worked in the coal and steel sectors of the greater Pittsburgh region.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>The Mays were one of the wealthy families of Ligonier, Pennsylvania, and were Olivia’s maternal ancestors.</p><p>On November 7, 1984, Joe and Deborah Lynne Mays, the parents of Olivia, got married. The low-key wedding took place in the backyard of a friend of Deborah’s in Fort Lauderdale, Florida’s Coral Ridge Country Club. Numerous people attended the wedding along the pool.</p><p>Joe Namath, the father of Olivia Namath, initially met his ex-wife in the early 1980s. The seasoned quarterback had made the decision to enroll in Arthur Joseph’s vocal coaching course at the time. Mays, coincidentally, was a student at the same college.</p><p>Joe had just begun his session with Arthur, and Mays had already finished hers. Mays and Arthur had been acquainted for a short time, and she had even told him about her wedding preparations. In the biography of Joe Namath, Arthur claimed it was a vision she had. She had always hoped to marry a football player and start a family.</p><p>Joe and Mays welcomed their first child, a daughter named Jessica Namath, after around a year of marriage. Joe gave birth to her second child, Olivia Namath, on December 11, 1990, some years after the first.</p><p>He and Mays’ relationship deteriorated after raising two daughters. In September 1998, Deborah will leave Joe’s home and begin a new life in California. There fell in love with Brian Novack, a surgeon. Mays reportedly stated that Novack had grown on her and that she was becoming bored with Olivia’s father.</p><p>In 2000, Olivia’s biological parents divorced formally, and her father was awarded sole custody of her and her sister. The two-time father now resides in his 1.5-acre home in Tequesta, Florida. Joe’s home contains a swimming pool, a boat dock, four bedrooms, and three bathrooms. The Tequesta neighborhood also has a private 18-hole golf course.</p><p>Jessica, an older sister who is around four years older than her, is the only sibling she has. Jessica graduated from the same university as her father, the University of Alabama.</p><p>The older sister of Olivia, Olivia, wed Brian Kennedy, with whom she has a son. In August 2019, Jessica filed for divorce after their relationship broke down.</p><p>Natalia, a girl, was born to Olivia Namath and her husband in West Palm Beach in August 2007. At the time, she was sixteen. People said that Natalia was living with Mays in California at the time for an illogical reason. She was still in Florida’s high school at the time.</p><p>Joe, Olivia’s father, told the Palm Beach Post that Natalia’s birth was one of the amazing things that happened after Olivia’s kid was born. He said, “I’m glad to hear that everyone is healthy.”</p><p>The father was identified on the baby’s birth certificate as Edwin Baker III, who was 19 at the time. As a matter of fact, Jupiter, Florida is where Olivia’s husband Baker was born. He was detained by the police three times in 2006 on suspicion of burglary, grand larceny, and possession of crystal methamphetamine. Police arrested him and accused him of robbing a McDonald’s store a year earlier.</p><p>The infant was taken to live with Joe’s ex-wife in California, according to The Daily News, so that Olivia could finish high school.</p><p>In 2013, Olivia Namath wed Baker at the Ca’d’Zan, the famed home of circus tycoon John Ringling. Natalia, the couple’s daughter, was previously mentioned.</p><p>Baker, Olivia’s spouse, is a professional artist whose work is influenced by street art and who has drawn inspiration from painters like Picasso and Basquiat.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>A Look At The Success And Relationships Of Joan- Baez</a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Is Suge Knight Still Alive?
