However, the standout receiver isn’t just doing exceptionally in the court, he is amicably doing fine in his personal life as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Jefferson now seems to have his very own girlfriend. According to Instagram predictions, he is seeing Tianna Harris.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Justin-Jefferson-Girlfriend.jpg><p>Fitness model Hails, and Vikings wide receiver Jefferson were recently sighted together in San Antonio for a camp that Jefferson organized last year, which led to relationship rumors.</p><p>Based on their social media activity, it appears that the two started dating about 2020.</p><p>Additionally, on April 26, 2021, Tianna, a sportsperson for Kent State Women’s Soccer, shared a photo of herself with her proud girlfriend on Twitter.</p><h2>Justin Jefferson&nbsp;| Net Worth</h2><p>In 2022, Justin Jefferson’s estimated <strong>net worth</strong> is <strong>$7 million</strong>.

Jefferson was taken by the Minnesota Vikings with the No. 22 overall choice in the 2020 NFL Draft.</p><p>Additionally, he said some very intriguing things about Joe Burrow, a former LSU teammate, and Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins.</p><p>It is clear from the way Jefferson speaks that Cousins does not share Burrow’s degree of confidence. It’s just odd to hear a wide receiver say that out loud about his quarterback, although let’s imagine that most people feel the same way. It also seems like Cousins can’t take a blow, according to Jefferson.</p><p>Jefferson continued to criticize Cousins after his initial remarks.</p><p><a href=#>You also might be interested in the NBA, where there is a mesmerizing talent who plays for FC Barcelona: Dante Exum: Career, Family & Net Worth>>></a></p><h2>Justin Jefferson&nbsp;| Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>Is Justin Jefferson related to Jordan Jefferson?</h3><p>During this episode of The Vikings Audible presented by Verizon, hosts Gabe Henderson and Ben Leber are joined by Vikings wide receiver Justin Jefferson and his brother Jordan Jefferson, a former LSU quarterback.</p><h3>Did Justin Jefferson invent the Griddy?</h3><p>Although he did not create the dance, wide receiver Jefferson of the Minnesota Vikings was the first NFL player to incorporate it into the wildly popular video game Fortnite.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunDDx6hkoqtdn8K0wMinZKOdlpuys7%2FOp2Y%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-justin-jefferson-2023-update.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-justin-jefferson-2023-update.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-justin-jefferson-2023-update.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-justin-jefferson-2023-update.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-justin-jefferson-2023-update.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-justin-jefferson-2023-update.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./charla-mack-murder-where-is-darren-mack-now.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./charla-mack-murder-where-is-darren-mack-now.html>Charla Mack Murder: Where is Darren Mack Now?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-collapse-of-a-dance-floor-at-a-graduation-party-in-peru.html>The collapse of a dance floor at a graduation party in Peru</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-collapse-of-a-dance-floor-at-a-graduation-party-in-peru.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
