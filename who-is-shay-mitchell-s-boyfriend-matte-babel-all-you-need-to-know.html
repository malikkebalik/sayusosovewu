She became well-known for her role as Emily Fields in the mystery-thriller drama series Pretty Little Liars (2010–2017), for which she was nominated for a People’s Choice Award and six Teen Choice Awards.</p><p>She is better known now because she played Peach Salinger in the 2018 psychological thriller series You and Stella Cole in the Hulu comedy series Dollface (2019–2022). She is currently the voice of Alexandra Trese in the Netflix animated series Trese (2021–present).</p><p>Mitchell made her first feature film as Nicole in the musical drama Dreamland. Before that, she had been in a number of short films (2016). She then played Tina in the 2016 comedy movie Mother’s Day and Megan Reed in the 2018 horror movie The Possession of Hannah Grace.</p><p>Aside from acting, she is known for her image in the media and her work as an activist.

Even though Shay and Matte are clearly committed to each other and their families, they are not planning to get married any time soon.</p><p>“I don’t know if anything I’ve done makes sense. I didn’t have a child before I got married. I had a baby but never got married. I’m not sure if that’s really in the cards for us. I’m not sure, but I think you and I agree, or maybe it’s just me. Shay told People in August 2021, “I’m not in a hurry to get married.”</p><p>“Don’t feel any pressure. I love it. I love that every day when we come home, I can say, “I chose you, and you chose me.” “It keeps us on our toes,” said the Dollface character. “I said, ‘Hey, I can leave. I don’t need a lawyer, I can just walk away.’ The same goes for him. It keeps things hot. I think both of us like it this way.”</p><p>Shay said in the same interview that she’d “love to” have more kids, and she did just that.</p><h2>Shay Mitchell And Matte Babel Are Going To Have Their Second Child.</h2><p>“The great cycle of life is saying goodbye to a loved one and being happy to welcome a new one into the world at the same time. It’s also the hardest season I’ve ever had. Shay posted a maternity photo on Instagram on February 7, 2022, with the caption, “I can’t help but think this was the universe’s plan all along, knowing I would need happiness from somewhere else to help me get over the loss of one of the most important people in my life.” She was referring to the death of her grandmother a week before.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Shay Mitchell (@shaymitchell)</a></p><p>“But this shows that love, life, and loss can all be very real at the same time. Gram, every day I miss you. “We can’t wait to meet you, little one,” she said. “I’m relieved to know that you two are already linked in such a cosmic way.”</p><p>Matte didn’t make his own announcement, but he has talked about his family on social media before. “Being a mom is always about love and giving up things.
