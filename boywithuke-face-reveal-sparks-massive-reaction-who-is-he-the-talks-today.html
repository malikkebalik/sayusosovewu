Thus, BoyWithUke’s face reveal sparking a lot of online discussion may not come as a surprise.</p><p>The surprise will be in how he looks—something he has hidden from his lovely fans for a very long time. When he finally got to reveal his face to his people, there were several questions, as he became a topical issue among fans on social media.</p><p>After BoyWithUke’s face was revealed, people wanted to learn about his age, Wikipedia information, and who he really is. So, who is BoyWithUke?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-boywithuke><strong>Who Is BoyWithUke?</strong></h2><p>BoyWithUke is the stage name for Charley Yang, an American-Korean singer, musician, and internet personality. He first became well-known on the social media app TikTok with his tune “Two Moons” before becoming well-known for his succeeding songs “Toxic” and “Understand”. Up until October 2023, he remained anonymous. Currently, Mercury Records, a branch of UMG, is his label.</p><p>After being introduced to TikTok by his brother in 2020, BoyWithUke started submitting videos there. Until 2021, some of his videos—including a series of videos named “Minute-Long Songs”—performed well on the site but did not initially draw much attention.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-boywithuke-age-how-old-is-he><strong>BoyWithUke Age: How Old Is He?</strong></h2><p>BoyWithUke’s age is currently 21 years old, after being born on August 25, 2002.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-boywithuke-face-reveal><strong>BoyWithUke Face Reveal</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>BoyWithUke’s face reveal has indeed revealed a lot of things about him. BoyWithUke maintained his anonymity up until October 2023 by donning an opaque face shield with two sizable LEDs. The ukulele serves as the main musical instrument in his compositions, but other instruments like the piano are also used. On his iPad, using GarageBand, a free digital audio workstation for Apple devices, he composes his own music.</p><p>“Alternative” and “alt-pop” have been used to define BoyWithUke’s music.</p><p>The four albums by BoyWithUke all have the word “dreams” in the title. In Melatonin Dreams, there was a lot of discussion on depression and suicide ideation. Low self-esteem and other generally depressing and melancholy themes are emphasized in Fever Dreams.</p><p>It cannot be denied that BoyWithUke has a sizable following. But when he published an image of himself without the mask, his fans went absolutely crazy. In just a few hours after posting the photo to Instagram, it received a ton of likes and comments. His face was revealed, and people responded by leaving plenty of encouraging comments on his post.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-boywithuke-wikipedia><strong>BoyWithUke Wikipedia</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-image size-full">BoyWithUke</figure><p>BoyWithUke has been featured on Wikipedia; thus, BoyWithUke’s Wikipedia page exists when you make a search on his name. Until BoyWithUke’s face reveal, not much was known about his personal life. Most of BoyWithUke’s personal affairs are kept secret. His claim that he was born in Daegu was made during his performance at the Seoul Jazz Festival.</p><p>Additionally, he has stated that he resides in Boston, Massachusetts. BoyWithUke claimed that he was compelled to listen to classical music starting at age four but eventually gave it up. He then picked up music again by penning songs in high school. BoyWithUke said that he remained anonymous because he preferred for people to focus on his songs and talent rather than his appearance.</p><p>According to Luminate Data, as of September 2023, he had seven million TikTok followers and approximately 200,000 American streams.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrBorjKrKuonJGue6S7zGiZqLGnnsGpwcqeZJ%2BZk5p6s7HVnpilZaOlrrO30makmqujnsOmedGemJysmaS7bsPHqGSiq12dsnA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fboywithuke-face-reveal-sparks-massive-reaction-who-is-he-the-talks-today.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fboywithuke-face-reveal-sparks-massive-reaction-who-is-he-the-talks-today.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fboywithuke-face-reveal-sparks-massive-reaction-who-is-he-the-talks-today.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fboywithuke-face-reveal-sparks-massive-reaction-who-is-he-the-talks-today.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fboywithuke-face-reveal-sparks-massive-reaction-who-is-he-the-talks-today.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fboywithuke-face-reveal-sparks-massive-reaction-who-is-he-the-talks-today.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./cop-who-fatally-shot-exonerated-man-was-fired-in-2017-for-using-excessive-force-during-traffic-stop.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./cop-who-fatally-shot-exonerated-man-was-fired-in-2017-for-using-excessive-force-during-traffic-stop.html>Cop who fatally shot exonerated man was fired in 2017 for using excessive force during traffic stop</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./black-thought-rapper-height-weight-age-spouse-children-biography.html>Black Thought (Rapper) Height, Weight, Age, Spouse, Children, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./black-thought-rapper-height-weight-age-spouse-children-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
