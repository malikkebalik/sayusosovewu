The ‘strange’ tatoo has been described by some as being for the Chicago Bulls and other say the Texas Longhorns. Don’t know for sure but I would bet that it has nothing to do with a gang or satanic cult.</p><p>I cannot stand tatoos, but it seems to be the rage among<br>young people… but it always reminds me of the ghetto, IMO.</p><p>Quote <strong>deceived</strong>: They keep showing this strange tattoo in the middle of Stitch's back... was he in a gang, and had to kill someone to get out???
