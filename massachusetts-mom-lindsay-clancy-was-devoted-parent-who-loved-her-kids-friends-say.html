The children were found by their father with exercise bands still around their necks.</p><p>Prosecutors alleged Clancy, who is still recovering from her injuries at a hospital, planned the murders and carried them out in their home where the kids should’ve felt safest.</p><p>But Clancy’s defense lawyer said his client was struggling with mental illness, and was prescribed about a dozen medications to get it under control. Defense attorney Kevin Reddington argued in court last week, “This was a situation that was clearly the product of mental illness.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">A woman lays flowers down at a makeshift memorial in front of 47 Summer Street on January 26, 2023 in Duxbury, Massachusetts. <span class=credit>MediaNews Group via Getty Images</span></figure><p>The prosecution countered that Clancy has been evaluated by mental health professionals who told her she didn’t have postpartum depression or symptoms related to it.</p><p>Maternal child health nurse Stacey Kabat wrote she was shocked by the number of meds Clancy was on leading up to the Jan. 24 attack on her kids.</p><p>“Our health care model fails family’s [sic] like the Clancy family,” Kabat wrote, according to Boston.com “We do very little to concretely help a mother who is suffering with postpartum depression and when it comes to postpartum psychosis we fail completely.”</p><p>Kabot, who met Clancy in nursing school, additionally wrote she believes if Clancy “had proper treatment, this family would still be together,” the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Patriot Ledger reported.</a></p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">A police cruiser sits in the driveway at 47 Summer Street, the home of Clancy, who strangled her three children and then attempted suicide on January 25, 2023 in Duxbury, Massachusetts. <span class=credit>MediaNews Group via Getty Images</span></figure><p>Another letter from dozens of mothers in the state also backed Clancy, the outlet reported.</p><p>“As mothers, we are asked to hold the weight of the world on our shoulders. We push through the pain and smile despite our inward battles,” they reportedly wrote.</p><p>“Many of us have felt the darkness of postpartum depression, and for that reason we are able to empathize with Lindsay’s pain.”</p><p>Friend Amy Bevins said Clancy’s top priority was making sure her children felt “loved, safe, and happy,” Boston.com reported.</p><p>“I trusted her implicitly with the care of my own child over the past three and a half years,” Bevins wrote. “I am steadfast in my belief that her greatest joy was being a mom and watching her children grow.”</p><p>With Post wires</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2tmamxfoq60v8Ccn66rlanBtHnMqKRmpJmjsbSt2GaapZmemMZuw8CsZJ2dpqTBprCMqZirnZ6peri0zmajqK6VmXqpsdFmoqKco2Kzs7XEp5usZaOWxnA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmassachusetts-mom-lindsay-clancy-was-devoted-parent-who-loved-her-kids-friends-say.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmassachusetts-mom-lindsay-clancy-was-devoted-parent-who-loved-her-kids-friends-say.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmassachusetts-mom-lindsay-clancy-was-devoted-parent-who-loved-her-kids-friends-say.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmassachusetts-mom-lindsay-clancy-was-devoted-parent-who-loved-her-kids-friends-say.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmassachusetts-mom-lindsay-clancy-was-devoted-parent-who-loved-her-kids-friends-say.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmassachusetts-mom-lindsay-clancy-was-devoted-parent-who-loved-her-kids-friends-say.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./nikki-bella-net-worth-kahawatungu.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./nikki-bella-net-worth-kahawatungu.html>Nikki Bella Net Worth - KahawaTungu</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kyle-jamison.html>Kyle Jamison</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kyle-jamison.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
