Born on 6th January 1953, Malcolm is the sixth child of the family who migrated to Australia when he was 10 years old. He picked up guitar at a young age and has been entertaining us since 1973.</p><p>The co-founder of band AC/DC, how rich is Malcolm Young? According to recent estimations, Malcolm has a net worth of $100 million. His major source of income is obviously his ever successful career in music. As the band has sold millions of copies of albums to date, his wealth seems reasonable enough.</p><h3>Malcolm Young Net Worth $100 Million</h3><p>Since his early age Malcolm had interest in music and had joined a band but it failed to succeed. At the age of 20, he founded the legendary band AC/DC and soon asked his younger brother <a href=#>Angus</a> to join the band. The group suffered a serious blow in 1980 when the lead vocalist <a href=#>Bon Scott</a> died effectively due to alcohol poisoning; the vacant spot was later filled by <a href=#>Brian Johnson</a>. Later that year they released a new album “Back in Black” as tribute to <a href=#>Bon Scott</a>. The album became their all-time best seller and took their name to new heights. Their next album “For Those About to Rock We Salute You” became their first album to reach number one in US charts.</p><p>Since gaining prominence in 1970s, the band has released 15 albums to date. Malcolm’s wealth started to grow in 1973 when the band released its first album “High Voltage”. It was a huge commercial success in Australia and received 5x platinum certification from the Australian Recording Industries Association. It included hits like “Stick around” and “You Ain’t Got Hold of Me”. The album was released worldwide after a year, managing to sell over there million copies in the US only. The high net worth of Young should not come as a surprise as the band has managed to sell over 200 million album copies worldwide.</p><p>Malcolm has been a prominent figure in the band, except for a brief absence in 1988. He is regarded as the brains and businessman behind the band. He takes credit for many famous AC/DC’s guitar riffs, and he and his brother <a href=#>Angus</a> are both to be credited for the overall music. He, unlike <a href=#>Angus</a> who is famous for the school boy dress-up and energetic performance, has a stoic presence, bashing out riffs on his battered guitar. AC/DC concerts have invariably been sell-outs wherever the band has performed around the world over many years – they probably enjoy their reputation of being the loudest rock ‘n’ roll band in the world</p><p>Malcolm is considered as one of the richest and most skilled rhythm guitarists of all time. His riffs and skilled song writing has led the band to win over 12 major awards including a Grammy Award, MTV VMAs and many prestigious awards. In 2003, Young and other members of band were inducted into the Rock ‘n’ Roll Hall of fame.</p><p>Regretfully, having been with his band AC/DC since its foundation, Malcolm retired from the band permanently in 2014 due to health related issues related to dementia.</p><p>About his personal life, Malcolm is married to Linda and they have two children. Malcolm along with his brother has contributed largely to the Rock ‘n’ Roll genre. Hopefully he can now still enjoy the fruits of his many years in the music industry.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=9.7164179104478><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$100 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>January 6, 1953</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Glasgow, United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 2 in (1.6 m)</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Profession</td><td>Musician, Record producer, Songwriter, Guitarist, Film Score Composer, Singer, Actor</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>Australia</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Linda Young</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Siblings</td><td>Angus Young, George Young, Alexander Young, Margaret Young</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Nicknames</td><td>Young, Malcolm , Malcolm Mitchell Young , Mal , AC/DC</td></tr><tr readability=0.23529411764706><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://imdb.com/name/nm2446227</a></td></tr></table><h3>Known for movies</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/networthpost.org/wp-content/themes/net-worth/images/celebrity_net_worth.png><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqaYpZufobpuxc6upaBlnprBbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmalcolm-young-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmalcolm-young-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmalcolm-young-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmalcolm-young-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmalcolm-young-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmalcolm-young-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./poses-in-bra-for-tmrw-hollywood-life.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./poses-in-bra-for-tmrw-hollywood-life.html>Poses In Bra For Tmrw Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./joseline-hernandez-jokes-about-arrest-warrant-for-alleged-battery.html>Joseline Hernandez Jokes About Arrest Warrant For Alleged Battery</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./joseline-hernandez-jokes-about-arrest-warrant-for-alleged-battery.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
