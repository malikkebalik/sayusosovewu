He has also been named to be one of the best storytellers of all time and has been called by the Q magazine as the rap’s finest storyteller.</p><p>His storytelling instincts have been praised also by Pitchfork media and several other media outlets. After the group achieved breakthrough success with their 1993 debut, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), the members went on to pursue solo careers to varying levels of success.</p><p>His debut in solo-career in 1996 with Ironman, which was well-received by music critics. He would continue his career, creating additional award-winning albums over the following years such as Supreme Clientele, Fishscale, More Fish, and The Big Doe Rehab.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-915 data-method=placement-service></span><p>Ghostface Killah is critically acclaimed for his loud, fast-paced flow, and his stream-of-consciousness narratives containing cryptic slang and non-sequiturs. He got raised in the Stapleton housing projects in Staten Island, New York.</p><p>In his autobiographical song “All That I Got Is You”, Ghost tells the story of his childhood. He raps about how he grew up in a three-bedroom apartment without his father, who left him at the age of six. Apparently, his mother had nine children.</p><h2>Ghostface Killah Couples Therapy</h2><p>Ghostface Killah was on Couples Therapy last night got exactly what he deserved and learned some valuable lessons! &nbsp;Ghostface was the highlight on the Couples Therapy episode, whose two-timing ways backfired on him his losing both girlfriends, Kelsey and Latrice, in the same Therapy episode.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-916 data-method=placement-service></span><p>In the biggest reality love triangle in all of Couples Therapy, two out of three parts walked away leaving Killah in a directionless straight line. Ghostface Killah had invited Latrice into his couples therapy session with girlfriend Kelsey.</p><p>Ghostface said, right in front of Kelsey, that he likes making love to the other woman and loves Latrice. It was entirely uncalled for and made Kelsey so upset that she decided it was time to end her relationship with Killah.</p><p>It’s about time! Dr. Jenn obviously had been rooting for this outcome and told Kelsey out of the therapy session that she deserves more than crumbs of love. She deserves the whole cake.</p><p>I agree and the other Couples Therapy cast, mostly Taylor, were relived that Kelsey finally came to her senses about Ghostface. Not sure where this is going for the rest of VH1 Couples Therapy, but Kelsey definitely needs professional help to never get walked on by a Ghostface again.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-917 data-method=placement-service></span><p>After the couple ended their year-long relationship, Ghostface tried to salvage his relationship with the only woman that stuck around, Latrice. Ghostface and Latrice had been dating for a staggering 2 years and she had no idea that Kelsey was emotionally and physically involved with Killah.</p><p>The two had a couples therapy session to which Latrice had made up her mind that Ghostface had to ‘pack up his stuff and go.’ I was so impressed that VH1 Couples Therapy didn’t edit this in a dramatic way.</p><p>It was straight to the point and classy. Ghostface messed up and Latrice said, “I can’t trust him so without no trust, there’s really no us.” It made me enjoy the COuples Therapy much more because it was honest and real without being explosive.</p><p>I had had my doubts about the authenticity of the show, but this episode really put my doubts to rest. The couples had a compatibility test and to nobody’s surprise, Kelsey and Ghostface were incompatible. Even less shocking was Jon Gosselin and his girlfriend Liz were deemed incompatible as well.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-918 data-method=placement-service></span><p>Jon Gosselin didn’t believe the compatibility test results but the other cast members and viewers were not surprised. Liz has been nothing but emasculating and disrespectful to Jon. The only thing they were compatible with what they drink and smoke similarly!</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Ghostface Killah R<strong>apper&nbsp;</strong></h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><h3><span id=Def_Jam class=mw-headline>Def Jam</span></h3><p>In 2003, Ghostface signed with&nbsp;Def Jam Records.
