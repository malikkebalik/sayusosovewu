I got home, mounted it, and promptly forgot about it for almost a decade.”</p><p>The Jurassic-era specimen was finally properly identified when Skvarla taught an online course based on his personal insect collection during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/large-copy.jpg><p>As his students followed along on Zoom with microscopes, Skvarla noticed that the bug which he’d previously thought was part of the antlion species group, looked more like a lacewing — which boasts wingspans of up to two inches.</p><p>“We were watching what Dr. Skvarla saw under his microscope and he’s talking about the features and then just kinda stops,” Codey Mathis, a doctoral candidate in entomology at Penn State, said.</p><p>“We all realized together that the insect was not what it was labeled and was in fact a super-rare giant lacewing. I still remember the feeling. It was so gratifying to know that the excitement doesn’t dim, the wonder isn’t lost. Here we were making a true discovery in the middle of an online lab course.”</p><p>“It was one of those experiences you don’t expect to have in a prerequisite lab course,” said Louis Nastasi, a doctoral candidate studying entomology at Penn State.</p><p>“Here we were, just looking at specimens to identify them, and all of a sudden, out of nowhere, this incredible new record pops up.”</p><p>Skvarla and other experts then performed molecular DNA analyses on the insect to confirm it was in fact a Polystoechotes punctata, or giant lacewing, the release said.</p><h3 class="inline-module__title headline headline--combo-sm-md">Keep up with today's most important news</h3><p class=inline-module__cta>Stay up on the very latest with Evening Update.</p><p><h3 class="inline-module__title headline headline--combo-sm-md">Thanks for signing up!</h3></p><p>Extensive collection records of the species were analyzed, showing giant lacewings had been spotted from Alaska to Panama — but hadn’t been seen in the eastern part of the continent for half a century.</p><p>Skvarla said it remained a mystery how the bug ended up in Fayetteville after it was presumed to have disappeared from the entire region.</p><p>One theory is that the species — who thrive in post-fire environments — had been driven away by better forest fire prevention in the area, along with urbanization, which had introduced non-native predators.</p><p>“Entomology can function as a leading indicator for ecology,” Skvarla said. “The fact that this insect was spotted in a region that it hasn’t been seen in over half a century tells us something more broadly about the environment.”</p><p>Skvarla also said the biodiversity hotspot Ozark Mountains were understudied compared to areas of similar biodiversity, such as the Southern Appalachians.</p><p>“This combination makes the region an ideal place for a large, showy insect to hide undetected,” wrote Skvarla and the co-author of his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">paper about the findings</a>, J. Ray Fisher of the Mississippi Entomological Museum at Mississippi State University</p><p>Those theories don’t explain how the creature found its way to the exterior of a Walmart, but Skvarla reportedly hypothesized it was attracted to the lights on the side of the building.</p><p>“It could have been 100 years since it was even in this area — and it’s been years since it’s been spotted anywhere near it. The next closest place that they’ve been found was 1,200 miles away, so very unlikely it would have traveled that far.”</p><p>Nastasi, the doctoral candidate, said it was exciting to think that the insect represented a regional population that had avoided both extinction and detection.</p><p>“Discovery doesn’t always hold that same kind of grasp on people that maybe it did 100 years ago,” he said, according to the school.</p><p>“But a finding like this really highlights that even in a run-of-the-mill situation, there are still a tremendous number of discoveries to make about insects.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2tma3Bfp66zsYyjrKuZo6i2pHnEq5hmoZ6osqTAjJ%2BmrqaUYq61ecCropqmo5bAbsPApaSaqqRk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frare-jurassic-era-insect-found-at-arkansas-walmart.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2frare-jurassic-era-insect-found-at-arkansas-walmart.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2frare-jurassic-era-insect-found-at-arkansas-walmart.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2frare-jurassic-era-insect-found-at-arkansas-walmart.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frare-jurassic-era-insect-found-at-arkansas-walmart.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2frare-jurassic-era-insect-found-at-arkansas-walmart.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./blackfoot-animal-shelter-hosts-empty-the-shelters-event.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./blackfoot-animal-shelter-hosts-empty-the-shelters-event.html>Blackfoot animal shelter hosts 'empty the shelters' event</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./quinton-griggs-age-height-net-worth-girlfriend-career.html>Quinton Griggs- Age, Height, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Career</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./quinton-griggs-age-height-net-worth-girlfriend-career.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
