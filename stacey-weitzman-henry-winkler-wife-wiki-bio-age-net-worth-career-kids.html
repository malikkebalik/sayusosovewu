<time>08 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>If anyone deserves to give a lecture on marriage and relationships, it has to be Stacey Weitzman and Henry Winkler. The pair have been married for 44 years and together for almost 46 years. And given how stars are constantly breaking up today, it’s amazing how the pair managed nearly a half-century of togetherness. But if you were to ask any one of them, it’s all about appreciating the other and sharing interests. Even after four decades of relationship, Stacey still thinks Henry is the most handsome man around and Henry believes Stacey is quite the catch. Over the years, the pair have been through everything together including Stacey’s cancer. And while Henry is known around the world, Stacey’s fame has been shadowed by her husband. So, for this article, we will take a closer look at the wiki-bio of Stacey Weitzman.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Early Life:</h2><p>Stacey Weitzman was born on the 15th of November, 1947, in Los Angeles, California. At the time, her father worked in a private office, while her mother worked as a nurse. During her early years, Stacye wanted to study fashion design in college but ended up pursuing higher education in economics and business at the University of North California. As a young kid, Stacey loved dancing and attended dancing classes from a relatively young age.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Harry-Winkler-wife-Stacey-Weitzman.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Professional Career:</h2><p>Much of what’s known of Stacey’s career is intertwined with Henry’s life and his status as a superstar. Following her graduation from the University of North California, Stacey opened her private fashion PR firm. Stacey found success in her early years and worked with reputed clients including Van Cleef & Arpels and Jag. Stacey met Winkler at the same time her career started gathering force. Eventually, Stacey stopped her PR practices and accompanied her husband. While she has had a couple of stints as an actress, in the 2001 movie, As Told by Ginger, and the 2005 drama, Touch, nothing came out of it. Stacey is also the founding member of the Children’s Action Network, which provides free immunization to 175,000 children and is running a national adoption campaign.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>First marriage:</h2><p>While Stacey has been known exclusively for her marriage to Henry Winkler, it is also true that she had been married before meeting Winkler. Stacey met her first husband, entertainment lawyer Howard Weitzman in 1968. The pair began dating and tied the knot on the 19th of October, 1969. While the pair didn’t have much time together, they had a son, Jed Weitzman, who was born in 1971. While the pair eventually divorced in 1976, not much is known about the reasons. Howard ended up marrying Margaret in 1981.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Marriage to Henry:</h2><p>Stacey didn’t remain single for a long time after her divorce from Howard. She met Winkler in 1976 at Jerry Magnin’s clothing shop in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles. The store belonged to one of her public relations clients, and Winkler came in looking for a sports coat. The pair had a brief conversation during their first visit and when he came back to pick up the coat a week later, Stacey was still in the shop. The pair went out for drinks and began dating soon after. While the pair never officially revealed that they were dating, Winkler once hinted to the media about Stacey as “someone who is intellectual enough to have her own life, and open enough to be in love with me.”</p><p>Within 5-months of dating, Stacey moved in with Winkler alongside her son Jed, and her two Yorkies, Amanda and Percy. The pair dated for two years before tying the knot on May 5, 1978, in the Manhattan synagogue. In the years of marriage, the pair has given birth to two children. Their daughter Zoe Winkler was born in 1980 followed by Max Daniel Winkler born on August 18, 1983.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Cancer:</h2><p>In 2001, Stacey was diagnosed with breast cancer. She was rushed to the hospital and the doctor advised a lumpectomy and intensive chemotherapy and removed one of her breasts. However, the cancer came back and Stacey had to undergo a double mastectomy. She has been cancer-free since and is committed to raising awareness against breast cancer.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Net Worth:</h2><p>Stacey operated a fashion PR firm back in the day and had a stint as an actress. Unlike her well-publicized relationship with her current husband, the details of her career are a few and scattered here and there. Also, there is no official record of her accumulated wealth over the years. When she married Winkler his acting career was already on an upward curve and she did her best to support him as a wife following the marriage. As of now, Henry Winkler has a net worth of $40 Million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A quick write on Henry Winkler:</h2><p>Henry Winkler, known professionally as “the Fonz,” is an American actor, director, producer, and author. He was born on October 30, 1945, in Manhattan, New York City.</p><p>Winkler rose to fame in the 1970s for his role as Arthur “Fonzie” Fonzarelli on the TV sitcom Happy Days. The character quickly became a cultural icon and turned Winkler into a household name. He won two Golden Globe Awards for his portrayal of the Fonz.</p><p>Despite being most well-known for his role as the Fonz, Winkler has had a long and successful career in the entertainment industry.
