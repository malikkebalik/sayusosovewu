She commands fame as an actress, notably for her roles as Ruth Martin in “Lassie” (1958-1964), Maureen Robinson in “Lost In Space” (1965-1968), and Dr. Janet Craig in the TV sitcom “Petticoat Junction” (1968-1970). Additionally, she is the proud recipient of two Emmy Awards and a Tony Award. Her illustrious career has been ongoing since 1938.</p><p>June Lockhart’s net worth stood at over $10 million, as estimated by authoritative sources in late 2016. This wealth has been amassed through her successful journey as a revered film and stage actress.</p><h3>June Lockhart’s Net Worth of $10 Million</h3><p>June Lockhart made her stage debut at the tender age of eight in a Metropolitan Opera production of “Peter Ibbetson.” After spending part of her childhood in New York, her family later moved to California. She continued to grace the stage with her presence, featuring in plays such as “For Love or Money” and “Kin Hubbard”. Simultaneously, she embarked on an on-screen career and has since appeared in 170 film and TV titles.</p><p>Her debut in the film industry was in 1938, starring alongside her parents in “A Christmas Carol”. Two years later, she featured in “All This, and Heaven Too” (1940). Building on this, June gained popularity during the 1940s with roles in acclaimed films such as “Sergeant York” (1941), “Meet Me in St. Louis” (1944), “She Wolf of London” (1946), and “Bury Me Dead” (1947), which significantly contributed to her increasing net worth.</p><p>Throughout the 1950s, June showcased her talent through television series such as “Robert Montgomery Presents” (1951-1957) and “The United States Steel Hour” (1954-1959). Her portrayal of Ruth Martin in the TV series “Lassie” (1958-1964) launched her further into the acting world. Notably, she returned to play Ruth in films such as “Lassie’s Great Adventure” (1963) and “Lassie: A Christmas Tail” (1963). A year after the show concluded, she took on the role of Maureen Robinson in “Lost in Space” (1965-1968), followed by her role as Dr. Janet Craig in “Petticoat Junction” (1968-1970), further boosting her net worth.</p><p>Even as she entered the 1970s, June continued to grace the big screen with films such as “But I Don’t Want to Get Married!” (1970). Her roles in subsequent films including “Who Is the Black Dahlia” (1975), “Just Tell Me You Love Me” (1978), and “The Gift of Love” (1978) continued to add to her net worth.</p><p>June’s active involvement in the film industry extended into the 1980s, with appearances in films including “Butterfly” (1982) and “The Capture of Grizzly Adams”. As she entered her seventh decade of life, she continued to land notable roles, featuring in successful films such as “Sleep With Me” (1994), “The Colony” (1995), and ‘Lost in Space” (1998). Consequently, her net worth remained substantial.</p><p>The 21st century has seen June remain active in the industry, making appearances in projects such as “The Thundering 8th” (2000), “Au Pair II” (2001), “Holiday in Handcuffs” (2007), “Zombie Hamlet” (2012), and her most recent lead role in “The Remake” (2016). Each venture has further contributed to her net worth.</p><p>June Lockhart’s remarkable skills earned her a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for both film and television. She received two nominations for the prestigious Primetime Emmy Award for her work on “Lassie”.</p><p>On the personal front, June Lockhart has been married twice. Her first husband was Dr. John Francis Maloney (1951-1959), with whom she has two daughters – Anne Lockhart and Lizabeth Lockhart – both actively engaged in the acting world. Her second marriage was to John Carl Lindsay from 1959 to 1970. She is also recognized as an Ambassador of the California State Parks system.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Trademarks</li><li>Quotes</li><li>Facts</li><li>Pictures</li><li>Filmography</li><li>Awards</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>June Lockhart</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$10 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>June 25, 1925</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>New York City, New York, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5′ 5″ (1.65 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actress</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Westlake School for Girls</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>John C.
