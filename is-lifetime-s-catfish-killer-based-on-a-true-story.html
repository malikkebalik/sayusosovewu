For the teenager, life could not be going better. Her best friends are always ready to have her back, and her mother is always ready to support her through her decisions. Additionally, she recently earned a prestigious scholarship for Stanford University. However, things take a sinister turn when the high schooler joins an online chatroom.</p><p>Through the messaging portal, Hannah meets a young boy and soon falls in love with him. But things are all is not as it seems, and the person she thinks she is talking to may not even exist. Starring Nicolette Langley, Alicia Leigh Willis, Jordan James Smith, and Ren Ashton, the film takes viewers on a suspenseful journey that one cannot help but be captivated by. However, fans of the movie cannot help but wonder how the plot came to be and if it is inspired by real-life events. Well, we are here to explore the same and find the answers!</p><h2>Is Catfish Killer a True Story?</h2><p>No, ‘Catfish Killer’ is not based on a true story. Instead, the film was written by Sandra Bailey, who has been the mind behind several other Lifetime projects. In fact, she has also penned ‘<a href=#>Deadly Infidelity Filmed</a>‘ and ‘Who Wants Me Dead?’ Bailey’s script was adapted into a movie under the direction of Olivia Kuan, who made her debut as a director with this particular film. Prior to this project, Kuan mainly worked as a cinematographer.</p><p>While Hannah’s story in the Lifetime film is fictional, it does contain several elements that one can easily find in real-life. The dangers of talking to strangers are always high, but conversing with unknown people on the internet comes with risks of its own. It is known that people assume fake identities in order to make others believe they are someone else. Known as catfishing, the most common use of this practice is to scam people out of their money, though sometimes things turn even more deadly.</p><p>Consider a November 2022 <a href=#>catfishing case</a> that took place in California. A teenage girl was catfished by a law enforcement officer, who developed an online persona and started a relationship with a girl. He ended up traveling to her home and getting caught up in an altercation. As a result, he took his victim into a car and drove away with her, while a fire in the girl’s house ended up killing three people. The suspect was later found and was killed during a SWAT operation. The teenager, fortunately, was not harmed in the process.</p><p>The case bears a heavy resemblance to the story told in the Lifetime film. It also lays bare the dire consequences of malicious catfishing and what it might result in. In the end, the victim lost her loved ones and was surely traumatized by the event. Unfortunately, this is far from the only case involving catfishing and teenage girls, and many often result in far worse consequences.</p><p>In other words, Hannah’s story in ‘Catfish Killer’ is a haunting reflection of many real-life cases with deadly consequences. The trouble that a model student gets into due to the maliciousness of an online stranger is sure to leave many people paranoid about online chatrooms, to say the least. The story’s similarities to several real-life cases add another layer of realism to the movie that reels the audience even more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwqrrEppihp5yesG%2BvzqZmoqtdobansdOipJ6rXZiutbLIrJ9mo5mhuaa%2BjJuYrJ2UYryvecBmq6utlWLAtbvRsmY%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-lifetime-s-catfish-killer-based-on-a-true-story.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fis-lifetime-s-catfish-killer-based-on-a-true-story.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fis-lifetime-s-catfish-killer-based-on-a-true-story.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fis-lifetime-s-catfish-killer-based-on-a-true-story.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-lifetime-s-catfish-killer-based-on-a-true-story.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-lifetime-s-catfish-killer-based-on-a-true-story.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kirstie-alley-height-weight-age-boyfriend-family-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kirstie-alley-height-weight-age-boyfriend-family-biography.html>Kirstie Alley Height, Weight, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./how-did-nicolas-kerdiles-die-cause-of-death-wikipedia.html>How Did Nicolas Kerdiles Die, Cause of Death, Wikipedia</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./how-did-nicolas-kerdiles-die-cause-of-death-wikipedia.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
